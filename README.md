# Intro
Once I went to a site with the purchase of things and thought, why not train a neural network that will recommend me those things that suit my taste? I chose sneakers as the main object of recommendation. My project consists of: 1) Scraping data from the site 2) Saving data via PostgreSQL 3) Data labeling 4) Training, Evaluation and Operation of the neural network 5) Interaction with the Telegram Bot API. For my project, I chose the Python language. For data scraping, I used BeautifulSoup and Selenium python libraries. To create a telegram bot, I used the Telegram Bot API. For training, evaluation and operation of my neural network, I used pytorch and timm. During the development of the project, I labeled about 1600 pictures through the telegram bot. Trained EfficientNetB0 on 300 epochs using this data. I taught the bot to take the output of the model to recommend sneakers, and as a result I got a telegram bot that really recommends only those sneakers that match my taste. I can even look at the price, brand name, model name and product link so I can immediately order the shoes I like!

#### Current agent's features:
- our bot can get closer to the boxes with loot
- our bot knows how to avoid red zone
- our bot is trying to get out of the red zone (if the zone has covered it)
- our bot begins to move chaotically, when enemies shoot at him
- our bot likes to build a route through the bushes

#### Further backlog:
- improve the agent's movement
- train the agent to properly interact with the loot and with the cursor, shoot, use helpful items
- optimize the agent control architecture
- delve deeper into RL algorithms

# Motivation
The goal is to develop a bot that is interesting to watch. The behavior of the bot should not differ from the behavior of a person in similar situations. Our research will help raise the level of AI in games, make games more interesting, and bots in them more similar to the actions of a real person.

We assume that if people are interested in watching other gamers (professional or not) through [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), then they will be interested in watching our agent as well.

# Installation guides

<details>
  <summary>Ubuntu\MacOS</summary>
  
  ## Initial usage
  __1. Clone GitHub repository__
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Laggg/ml-bots-surviv.io
  ```

  __2. Download supporting files__

  Download model weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1l3exfxwT4ZVk1R6V2sxZimTafx1EkNtO&export=download) and chromedriver, that suits your chrome version, from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (unzip it, if needed). 

  Locate both files to `./supporting_files/` folder.

  __3. Create python virtual environment and install requirements.txt__
  
  ```
  cd ml-bots-surviv.io
  python -m venv surviv_env 
  source surviv_env/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt 
  ```

    <summary>possible issues: </summary>
    
    Issue: Could not build wheels for opencv-python which use PEP 517 and cannot be installed directly
    Solution: `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`
  </details>


  __4. Run the agent__
  ```
  python play.py
  ```
  
  ## Later usage

  __1. Activate python environment__
  ```
  source surviv_env/bin/activate
  ``` 

  __2. Run the agent__
  ```

  ### Before the first launch
  
  **1.** Check that you have `Anaconda3` with `python3`

  **2.** Check that you have `google chrome browser` (our agent supports only chrome)

  ### For the first launch
  
  **0.** Earlier you do 1-2 steps from paragraph **"Before the first launch"**

  **1.** Clone repo by `Anaconda Prompt` or dowland zip-file repo and unzip it
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Laggg/ml-bots-surviv.io.git
  ```
  **2.** Dowland neural net weights from [source](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1l3exfxwT4ZVk1R6V2sxZimTafx1EkNtO&export=download) and put it into `./supporting_files/` folder

  **3.** Dowland driver for your OS and for your chrome version (don't forget to check your google chrome version!) from [link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), unzip it and put into `./supporting_files/` folder

  > after 3rd step you can check `./supporting_files/` folder:

  **4.** Open Anaconda prompt inside repo-folder
  > example:

  **5.** Create a virtual environment for this project
  ```
  python â€“m venv surviv_env
  ```
  **6.** Activate created virtual environment
  ```
  cd surviv_env/scripts && activate && cd ../../
  ```
  **7.** Install all required libraries
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  **8.** Launch the agent into the game!
  ```
  python play.py
  ```
  **9.** After all you can deactivate virtual env and close `Anaconda prompt` window

  ### For the second+ launch
  
  **0.** Earlier you do 1-9 steps from paragraph **"For the first launch"**

  **1.** Open `Anaconda prompt` inside repo-folder

  **2.** ```cd surviv_env/scripts && activate && cd ../../```

  **3.** ```python play.py```

  **4.** After all you can close deactivate virtual env and close `Anaconda prompt` window
